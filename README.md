# lab06

* This went went well and I honostly was slogging through the most of it. There was some jumping from what we learned in class versus what we had to implement to make things work.

* Although you can implement DOM method to create an HTML page using the JS page, it does seem easier to just edit the HTML and add `script links` of what you may need from the JS page to the HTML Page.

* This took me roughly 4 hours, with some professional help. I thought it would take me 4 hours to do **on my own**. I'm starting to see a pattern here...

--------------------
This lab involved setting a new code project based off of `Setting up a New 201 Code Project` template.

The Salmon Cookie project includes the below items:

1) 5 different cities

2) Each city contains open and close times

3) Each open and close times have total amount of cookies.

For this exercise we create objects with properties of city names, random functions to get random number of customers. A function that worked off of random number of customers to get random number of cookies.

We used helper functions to use up less code and lines, which helped the JS page look sleeker.

Most importantly, we implemented DOM to edit and add HTML code.
